## About me

### Personal

I am from [Ragusa, Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragusa,_Sicily), but I am currently living in [Turin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin).

While I was studying Architecture at school, I began experimenting software alternatives and knowing deeper how computers work. At the end of the school, I decided to leave Architecture as a passion, while focusing mainly on Computer Science and Programming.

Other passions I have are reading, music, and movies. I am working on a personal website in which I am going to collect all my passions, activities, and thoughts, so that you can know me better. I'll leave a link in this section once it is ready.

### Professional

I am a Computer Engineering student at [Polytechnique of Turin](https://polito.it), where I am attending a Master Degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics.

I will start an internship by the end of September 2024, which will lead me to the end of my academic adventure in February 2025.
